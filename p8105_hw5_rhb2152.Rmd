## Problem 1

The plot below shows that in general, the probability of having two people with the same birthday increases as the group size increases. The probability increase rate is faster as the group size increases from small sizes, but flattens out as the group size gets larger.

```{r, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)

set.seed(1)

bday = function(n) {
  days = sample(1:365,size=n,replace=TRUE)
  decision=FALSE
  for (i in 1:n) {
    for (j in 1:n) {
      if (i!=j) {
        if (days[i]==days[j]){
          decision=TRUE
        }
      }
    }
  }
  decision
}

prob = vector("numeric",length=49)

for (n in 2:50) {
  output = vector("numeric",length=10000)
  for (i in 1:10000) {
    output[i] = bday(n)
  }
  prob[n-1] = mean(output)
}

ggplot(mapping=aes(x=2:50,y=prob)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlab("Group Size") +
  ylab("Probability of Duplicate Birthdays")
